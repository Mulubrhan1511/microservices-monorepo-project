📖 Project Overview
This is a monorepo designed to demonstrate how to build and manage microservices in a NestJS application. The goal of this project is to help you understand the basics of microservice architecture and how to set up a project structure using the monorepo pattern.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/microservices-monorepo.git
2. Install Dependencies
Once you’ve cloned the repository, navigate into the project directory and install the dependencies for all the services.

If you're using Yarn (recommended for monorepos with Turbo), you can install the dependencies by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn install
Alternatively, if you're using npm, you can use:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3. Start the Services
You can use Turbo to run multiple services simultaneously in a monorepo.

For all services:
bash
Copy
Edit
yarn dev
This will start all services in development mode.

For individual services:
bash
Copy
Edit
yarn workspace <service-name> dev
Replace <service-name> with the name of the specific service you want to run.

🔧 Folder Structure
Here is a basic folder structure for the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
/microservices-monorepo
  ├── /apps
  │   ├── /service-one
  │   ├── /service-two
  │   └── /api-gateway
  ├── /libs
  │   ├── /shared
  │   └── /utils
  ├── package.json
  ├── turbo.json
  └── README.md
/apps: Contains the actual microservice applications (e.g., service-one, service-two, and api-gateway).
/libs: Contains reusable libraries that are shared across services (e.g., shared utilities, interfaces).
package.json: Defines project-wide dependencies and scripts for all services.
turbo.json: Configuration for Turbo to manage the workspace.
🔑 Services
In this project, we will have the following services:

Service One - A basic microservice that handles one domain.
Service Two - A second microservice handling a different domain.
API Gateway - An API Gateway to route requests to the respective microservices.
📡 Communication Between Services
The services communicate with each other via:

HTTP Requests (REST API)
Message Patterns (via message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ)
We are using NestJS for building microservices with message-based and HTTP-based communication patterns.

📝 To-Do
 Set up microservices with NestJS.
 Implement communication via REST API and message brokers.
 Build API Gateway for routing and aggregation.
 Add shared libraries and utilities for reuse.
 Write tests and integrate CI/CD.
🛠 Technologies Used
NestJS: A framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js applications.
Turbo: A build system for managing monorepos.
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
RabbitMQ (or Kafka): Message broker for communication between microservices.
Docker (optional): For containerizing microservices for easier deployment.
📈 Running in Production
To deploy your microservices, you will need to configure the deployment pipeline using Docker or any other containerization technology. If you choose Docker, you can use the following command to build and run your services inside containers:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --build
This will start all your services inside Docker containers.
